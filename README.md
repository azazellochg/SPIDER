SPIDER
======

Collection of spider scripts

Not well tested yet.  

The script provides non-iterative single-run alignment in SPIDER with AP SH, then AP REF against references - projection from 3D model. Final images are aligned with RT SF and normalized. 

TO-DO: implement iterative multi-reference alignment with increasing angular sampling in AP REF.
